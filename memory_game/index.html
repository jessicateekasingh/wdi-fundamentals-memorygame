<h2>WHY PLAY?</h2>
<p>The key to Jessi's Memory Game is that it involves both the stimulus of the mind and the body! The user must ensure that they are always engaged and ready at any moment as the game does get more complex as it progresses. We weren't rated the #1-most-mind-and-body-stimulating-game of United States 2020 for nothing!</p>



<h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
